      &emsp; In cell biology, mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of the cell cycle
      in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell
      division by mitosis gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the
      total number of chromosomes is maintained. Therefore, mitosis is also
      known as equational division. In general, mitosis is preceded by S phase
      of interphase (during which DNA replication occurs) and is often followed
      by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and
      cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal
      shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis
      altogether define the mitotic (M) phase of a cell cycle—the division of
      the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each
      other. The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the
      completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These
      stages are preprophase (specific to plant cells), prophase, prometaphase,
      metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which
      have already duplicated, condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull
      one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell. The result is
      two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then
      continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells. The
      different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time, using live
      cell imaging. Producing three or more daughter cells instead of the normal
      two is a mitotic error called tripolar mitosis or multipolar mitosis
      (direct cell triplication / multiplication). Other errors during mitosis
      can induce mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis (programmed cell death) or cause
      mutations. Certain types of cancer can arise from such mutations. Mitosis
      occurs only in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus,
      divide by a different process called binary fission. Mitosis varies
      between organisms. For example, animal cells undergo an "open" mitosis,
      where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate,
      whereas fungi undergo a "closed" mitosis, where chromosomes divide within
      an intact cell nucleus. Most animal cells undergo a shape change, known as
      mitotic cell rounding, to adopt a near spherical morphology at the start
      of mitosis. Most human cells are produced by mitotic cell division.
      Important exceptions include the gametes – sperm and egg cells – which are
      produced by meiosis.

    <p>
      &emsp; The primary result of mitosis and cytokinesis is the transfer of a
      parent cell's genome into two daughter cells. The genome is composed of a
      number of chromosomes—complexes of tightly coiled DNA that contain genetic
      information vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant
      daughter cell should be genetically identical to the parent cell, the
      parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This
      occurs during the S phase of interphase. Chromosome duplication results in
      two identical sister chromatids bound together by cohesin proteins at the
      centromere. When mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become
      visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the nuclear envelope,
      which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small
      vesicles. The nucleolus, which makes ribosomes in the cell, also
      disappears. Microtubules project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to
      the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The
      microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each
      chromosome apart. Sister chromatids at this point are called daughter
      chromosomes. As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are
      pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late
      anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter
      chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei. During mitotic
      progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo
      cytokinesis. In animal cells, a cell membrane pinches inward between the
      two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In plant cells, a cell
      plate forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur;
      coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis
      without cytokinesis. Interphase The mitotic phase is a relatively short
      period of the cell cycle. It alternates with the much longer interphase,
      where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division.
      Interphase is divided into three phases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis),
      and G2 (second gap). During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows
      by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are
      replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to
      grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for
      mitosis (G2), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle. All
      these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins,
      cyclin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow
      one another in strict order and there are "checkpoints" that give the cell
      cues to proceed from one phase to another. Cells may also temporarily or
      permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing. This
      can occur when cells become overcrowded (density-dependent inhibition) or
      when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism,
      as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons. Some G0 cells
      have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle. DNA double-strand breaks can
      be repaired during interphase by two principal processes. The first
      process, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends
      of DNA in the G1, S and G2 phases of interphase. The second process,
      homologous recombinational repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in
      repairing double-strand breaks. HRR is active during the S and G2 phases
      of interphase when DNA replication is either partially accomplished or
      after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent homologs.
      Interphase helps prepare the cell for mitotic division. It dictates
      whether the mitotic cell division will occur. It carefully stops the cell
      from proceeding whenever the cell's DNA is damaged or has not completed an
      important phase. The interphase is very important as it will determine if
      mitosis completes successfully. It will reduce the amount of damaged cells
      produced and the production of cancerous cells. A miscalculation by the
      key Interphase proteins could be crucial as the latter could potentially
      create cancerous cells. Today, more research is being done to understand
      specifically how the phases stated above occur.

    <h3>Prophase</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; During prophase, which occurs after G2 interphase, the cell
      prepares to divide by tightly condensing its chromosomes and initiating
      mitotic spindle formation. During interphase, the genetic material in the
      nucleus consists of loosely packed chromatin. At the onset of prophase,
      chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes that are typically
      visible at high magnification through a light microscope. In this stage,
      chromosomes are long, thin, and thread-like. Each chromosome has two
      chromatids. The two chromatids are joined at the centromere. Gene
      transcription ceases during prophase and does not resume until late
      anaphase to early G1 phase. The nucleolus also disappears during early
      prophase. Close to the nucleus of animal cells are structures called
      centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a loose
      collection of proteins. The centrosome is the coordinating center for the
      cell's microtubules. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division,
      which is duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins,
      giving a pair of centrosomes. The two centrosomes polymerize tubulin to
      help form a microtubule spindle apparatus. Motor proteins then push the
      centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell.
      Although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly, they are not
      essential for the formation of the spindle apparatus, since they are
      absent from plants, and are not absolutely required for animal cell
      mitosis.
    </p>
    <h3>Prometaphase</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; At the beginning of prometaphase in animal cells, phosphorylation
      of nuclear lamins causes the nuclear envelope to disintegrate into small
      membrane vesicles. As this happens, microtubules invade the nuclear space.
      This is called open mitosis, and it occurs in some multicellular
      organisms. Fungi and some protists, such as algae or trichomonads, undergo
      a variation called closed mitosis where the spindle forms inside the
      nucleus, or the microtubules penetrate the intact nuclear envelope. In
      late prometaphase, kinetochore microtubules begin to search for and attach
      to chromosomal kinetochores. A kinetochore is a proteinaceous
      microtubule-binding structure that forms on the chromosomal centromere
      during late prophase. A number of polar microtubules find and interact
      with corresponding polar microtubules from the opposite centrosome to form
      the mitotic spindle. Although the kinetochore structure and function are
      not fully understood, it is known that it contains some form of molecular
      motor. When a microtubule connects with the kinetochore, the motor
      activates, using energy from ATP to "crawl" up the tube toward the
      originating centrosome. This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation
      and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary
      to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.
    </p>
    <h3>Metaphase</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; After the microtubules have located and attached to the
      kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the
      chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension
      causes the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plate or equatorial
      plane, an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two
      centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell). To ensure
      equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the metaphase
      checkpoint guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the
      mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase
      plate. If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint,
      it proceeds to anaphase. Anaphase During anaphase A, the cohesins that
      bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, forming two identical
      daughter chromosomes. Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the
      newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. During
      anaphase B, polar microtubules push against each other, causing the cell
      to elongate. In late anaphase, chromosomes also reach their overall
      maximal condensation level, to help chromosome segregation and the
      re-formation of the nucleus. In most animal cells, anaphase A precedes
      anaphase B, but some vertebrate egg cells demonstrate the opposite order
      of events.
    </p>
    <h3>Telophase</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; Telophase (from the Greek word τελος meaning "end") is a reversal
      of prophase and prometaphase events. At telophase, the polar microtubules
      continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear
      envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane
      vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms
      around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane
      does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets
      of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to "relax"
      or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical
      set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time
      depending on the organism.

    />
    <p>
      &emsp; Cytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis, but rather a separate
      process necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a
      cleavage furrow (pinch) containing a contractile ring, develops where the
      metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei. In both
      animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived
      from the Golgi apparatus, which move along microtubules to the middle of
      the cell. In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the
      center of the phragmoplast and develops into a cell wall, separating the
      two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher
      plants, whereas some green algae use a phycoplast microtubule array during
      cytokinesis. Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its
      parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase. There
      are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming
      single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is
      among the fungi, slime molds, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is
      found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis
      may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly
      embryonic development.
